<p><b>François Boucher</b> (29 September 1703 – 30 May 1770) was a French painter, 
    draughtsman and etcher, who worked in the Rococo style. Boucher is known 
    for his idyllic and voluptuous paintings on classical themes, decorative 
    allegories, and pastoral scenes. He was perhaps the most celebrated 
    painter and decorative artist of the 18th century.</p>

    <p>A native of Paris, Boucher was the son of a lesser known painter Nicolas 
        Boucher, who gave him his first artistic training. At the age of 
        seventeen, a painting by Boucher was admired by the painter François 
        Lemoyne. Lemoyne later appointed Boucher as his apprentice, but after 
        only three months, he went to work for the engraver Jean-François Cars.</p>

    <p>In 1720, he won the elite Grand Prix de Rome for painting, but did not 
        take up the consequential opportunity to study in Italy until five years 
        later, due to financial problems at the Académie royale de peinture et 
        de sculpture. On his return from studying in Italy he was admitted to 
        the refounded Académie de peinture et de sculpture on 24 November 1731. 
        His morceau de réception (reception piece) was his Rinaldo and Armida of 
        1734.</p>
