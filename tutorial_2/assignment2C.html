        <h1>2020 Chemistry Nobel Prize</h1>
        <section>
            <p>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded annually by the <a href="https://kva.se/en/startsida">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. This award is administered by the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/the-nobel-prize-organisation/the-nobel-foundation/">Nobel Foundation</a>, and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on proposal of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry which consists of five members elected by the Academy. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.</p>

        <h2>Jennifer Doudna</h2>
        <section>
            <p><a href="https://doudnalab.org/bio/">Jennifer Anne Doudna</a> (born 1964) is an American biochemist who has done pioneering work in CRISPR gene editing, and made other fundamental contributions in biochemistry and genetics. She is the Li Ka Shing Chancellor's Chair Professor in the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. She has been an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1997. She graduated from Pomona College in 1985 and earned a Ph.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1989. Apart from her professorship at Berkeley, she is also president and chair of the board of the Innovative Genomics Institute, a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes, and an adjunct professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In 2012, Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier were the first to propose that CRISPR-Cas9 (enzymes from bacteria that control microbial immunity) could be used for programmable editing of genomes, which has been called one of the most significant discoveries in the history of biology. Since then, Doudna has been a leading figure in what is referred to as the "CRISPR revolution" for her fundamental work and leadership in developing CRISPR-mediated genome editing.<br>
            <br>
            Her many other prestigious awards and fellowships include the 2000 Alan T. Waterman Award for her research on the structure as determined by X-ray crystallography of a ribozyme, and the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology, with Charpentier. She has been a co-recipient of the Gruber Prize in Genetics (2015), the Tang Prize (2016), the Canada Gairdner International Award (2016), and the Japan Prize (2017). <br>
            <br>
            Outside the scientific community, she has been named one of the Time 100 most influential people in 2015, and she was listed as a runner-up for Time Person of the Year in 2016 alongside other CRISPR researchers. In 2017, she was the lead author of A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution, a rare case of the first-person account of a major scientific breakthrough, aimed at the general public, published shortly after the discovery.</p>

        <h2>Emmanuelle Charpentier</h2>
        <section>
            <p><a href="https://www.emmanuelle-charpentier-lab.org/">Emmanuelle Marie Charpentier</a> (born 1968) is a French professor and researcher in microbiology, genetics, and biochemistry. Since 2015, she has been a Director at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin. In 2018, she founded an independent research institute, the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens. In 2020, Charpentier and American biochemist Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for the development of a method for genome editing" (through CRISPR).</p>

        <h2>The development of a method for genome editing - CRISPR/Cas9</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier received the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for the development of a method for genome editing."<br>
            <br>
            In 2011, Charpentier met Jennifer Doudna at a research conference and they began a collaboration. Working with Jennifer Doudna's laboratory, Charpentier's laboratory showed that Cas9 could be used to make cuts in any DNA sequence desired. The method they developed involved the combination of Cas9 with easily created synthetic "guide RNA" molecules. Synthetic guide RNA is a chimera of crRNA and tracrRNA; therefore, this discovery demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas9 technology could be used to edit the genome with relative ease. Researchers worldwide have employed this method successfully to edit the DNA sequences of plants, animals, and laboratory cell lines. CRISPR has revolutionized genetics by allowing scientists to edit genes to probe their role in health and disease and to develop genetic therapies with the hope that it will prove safer and more effective than the first generation of gene therapies.</p>
